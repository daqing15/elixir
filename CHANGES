0.1.1
- Applied patch from Robin Munn to make the code python 2.3 compatible
- Per a suggestion on the mailing list, look at the calling stack frame to
  ensure that we apply statements to the proper class.  We now attach the
  statement list to the class itself, rather than attaching it to a global
  list that is neither threadsafe, nor safe when doing nested class 
  definition.  Also added a test to validate that this works.
- implemented singletable non-polymorphic inheritance
- added support to pass non-keyword arguments to tables. You just pass
  them to the using_table_options statement and they will be forwarded to the
  table along with the keyword arguments. This can be used to set table 
  constraints.
- added support for the nullable and column_kwargs kwargs on BelongsTo
  relationships (forwarded to the SA Column).
- added support for the use_alter and constraint_kwargs kwargs on BelongsTo
  relationships (forwarded to SA ForeignKeyConstraint).
    -> removed the systematic use_alter on BelongsTo relations since it
       can now be specified only when needed.
    -> removed it from HasAndBelongsToMany relations, since I think a
       circular foreign key dependency can't happen with those relations.
- corrected some docstrings
