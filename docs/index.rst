Elixir
======

Elixir is a declarative layer on top of `SQLAlchemy
<http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_, which is intended to replace the `ActiveMapper
<http://cleverdevil.org/computing/35/>`_ SQLAlchemy extension, and the
`TurboEntity <http://turboentity.ematia.de>`_ project. Elixir is a fairly thin
wrapper around SQLAlchemy, which provides the ability to define model objects
following the Active Record design pattern, and using a DSL syntax similar to
that of the Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord system.

Elixir does not intend to replace SQLAlchemy's core features, but instead
focuses on providing a simpler syntax for defining model objects when you do
not need the full expressiveness of SQLAlchemy's manual mapper definitions.
