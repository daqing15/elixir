Elixir is a declarative layer on top of `SQLAlchemy 
<http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_. It is a fairly thin wrapper, which provides 
the ability to define model objects following the Active Record design 
pattern, and using a DSL syntax similar to that of the Ruby on Rails 
ActiveRecord system.

Elixir does not intend to replace SQLAlchemy's core features, but instead
focuses on providing a simpler syntax for defining model objects when you do
not need the full expressiveness of SQLAlchemy's manual mapper definitions.

See docs/index.rst for the history of the project and other miscellaneous
information.
